Spring:
-------
Spring is also called as a application develop project.

By using spring we can develop below types of the applications

	1) Standalone applications
	2) Web Apps
	3) Distributed apps

Spring is a free and open source software.

Spring is developed in modular fashion.

Spring is coming into the picture/market in the year of 2014(1.0).

Latest/current version of the spring is 6.x.

Spring is non-invasive framework(spring not forcing to use all the module in the project).

spring is versatile framework(struts,hiberanate)

if we develop any application by using spring framework.
 Programmer responsibility to manage the configurations(spring-beans.xml).

Every project configurations are the common. 
if we are having common logic means why we need to write(we can automate)

spring  team is realized if we having common logic we can automate those logic.

spring team introduced the spring boot framework in the market.


Spring Boot:
-----------
Spring boot is an approach to develop the applications with less configurations.


Spring Boot is the extension of spring frame work.

Spring Boot internally uses spring frame only.

What type of the applications we can develop by using spring, 
same kind of the applications we can develop by using spring boot also.


Spring  = primary logic + Business logic + configurations

Sprng boot= primary logic + Business logic - configurations

Sprng boot= Spring Framework - configurations.

Advantages of the Spring Boot:
-----------------------------
1) Auto Configurations.
2) POM Starters.
3) Embedded Server(In-built servers).
4) Rapid application development.
5) Actuators
6) No need to mention versions also.


1) Auto Configurations(Custom/User beans + Predefined):
-----------------------
Automatically ioc container is going to identify spring bean classes based on the annotations+dependencies.

spring-starter-web 		-->   It is goint to start tomcat server.
spring-starter-mysql    -->   It is used to create the connection pool.(10)
spring-starter-mail     -->   It is used to create the smtp connections.
spring-starter-security -->   It is used to provide login page.


POM Starters:
-------------
Pom starter nothing but dependencies.

Embedded Server:
----------------
Embedded Server nothing but inbuilt servers. 
spring boot is providing the ready made server for the application development.

ex: tomcat,jetty,netty.....

Rapid application development:
------------------------------
	Rapid application development nothing but, We can develop applications quickly.

	When we are developing the applications we need to consontrate on business logic.

Actuators:
----------
Actuators are used to monitor and manage our application.
Actuators is built in concept.

How classes loaded
How many objects created
How many threads are running
what are urls available in the project
what is the heap dump
what is the thread dump.
what is the health of our project
we can stop our application

versions:
---------
No need to metion versions in the spring boot, 

based on the parent starter it will downlaod child dependecies.

How many ways we can create the spring app
------------------------------------------
1) By using IDE(Eclipse(install pluggin),Sts,Intellij).
2) start.spring.io



What is start class in the spring boot
-------------------------------------
When we create the spring boot application by default we will get main class this called as start class in the spring boot.

Start class is the entry point for the spring boot application execution.

@SpringBootApplication:
-----------------------
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@SpringBootConfiguration  OR @Configuration
@ComponentScan


@EnableAutoConfiguration:
-------------------------
Automatically ioc container is going to identify spring bean classes based on the annotations+dependencies.


@SpringBootConfiguration  OR @Configuration
--------------------------------------------------
I dont give chance to the ioc container for the object creation.

I will create the object and i will give the my object to the ioc container.

when we creating the configuration class at the method level we need place @bean annotation.

EX: SecuiryConfig, KafkaConfig, RedisConfig, SwaggerConfig......

@ComponentScan:
---------------
The process of scanning packages for the beans object creation called component scanning.

First scanning will be start from base package.

Base package: The package which contains the start class (in.thiruit)

Sub package : The package which start from the base package (in.thiruit.service.ojdsj)...
